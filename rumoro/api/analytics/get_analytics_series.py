    """Mentions over time

     Returns matched, relevant and sentiment counts per day or week over the period. You get one total
    series, or one per platform or keyword with `by`. Pick the period with `range` (7d, 30d, 90d or 365d
    up to today) or with `from` and `to`. Days follow `timezone`, UTC by default. `keywordIds` and
    `platforms` narrow the data, and `compare=true` adds the equally long period just before. Dates are
    publish dates.

    Args:
        range_ (GetAnalyticsSeriesRange | Unset): A preset period up to today, 30d by default.
            Ignored when you send from or to.
        from_ (str | Unset): Start date in `timezone`, as YYYY-MM-DD. That day is included.
        to (str | Unset): End date in `timezone`, as YYYY-MM-DD, included. Defaults to today.
        keyword_ids (list[str] | None | Unset): Keeps these keyword ids only. Repeat the parameter
            or separate values with commas. Leave it out for all keywords.
        platforms (list[GetAnalyticsSeriesPlatformsItem] | Unset): Keeps these platforms only.
            Repeat the parameter or separate values with commas. Leave it out for all platforms.
        compare (bool | Unset): true adds the equally long period just before as `previous`.
        timezone (str | Unset): The IANA time zone used to split days, such as America/New_York.
            Defaults to UTC. The zone's offset at the end of the period is used for the whole period.
        bucket (GetAnalyticsSeriesBucket | Unset): The size of each point. hour for periods up to
            14 days, day, week (starting Monday) or month. By default days up to 90 days and weeks
            beyond.
        by (GetAnalyticsSeriesBy | Unset): Splits the data into a series for each platform, each
            keyword or each sentiment (positive, neutral, negative, unclassified). By keyword you get
            the top 20 by matches, with the rest combined as "other". Leave it out for one total
            series.

    Raises:
        errors.UnexpectedStatus: If the server returns an undocumented status code and Client.raise_on_unexpected_status is True.
